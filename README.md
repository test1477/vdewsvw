It seems you're encountering an issue with the package manager designation in your SBOM generation script, specifically regarding the use of "pypi" versus "pip." This confusion arises from the way different package managers and ecosystems are represented in the context of Python packages.

### Understanding the Issue

1. **Pip vs. PyPI**:
   - **Pip**: This is the package installer for Python. It is used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other sources.
   - **PyPI**: This is the repository where Python packages are hosted. When specifying a package URL (purl), it is common to use "pypi" to indicate that the package comes from this repository.

2. **SBOM Generation**: In your SBOM generation script, if you want to keep "pip" as the package manager name instead of converting it to "pypi," you need to adjust how you handle package manager names in your script.

### Full Script with Adjustments

Hereâ€™s the complete script that retains "pip" as the package manager when constructing the SBOM:

```python

    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    process_single_repo(owner, repo_name, access_token, output_base)
```

### Key Adjustments Made:

1. **Package Manager Inference**: The `infer_package_manager` function now defaults to returning `pip` as the package manager when no specific prefix is detected. This ensures that any Python packages will be labeled correctly.

2. **PURL Construction**: The PURL (`purl`) and `bom-ref` are constructed using this inferred manager and name.

3. **Consistent Naming**: The naming conventions are designed to reflect what you would expect based on how packages are typically managed in Python environments.

### Usage Instructions:

- Replace `"your-repo-name"` with the actual name of your GitHub repository.
- Replace `"your-github-access-token"` with a valid GitHub access token.
- Adjust `output_base` to specify where you want to save the SBOM JSON file.

This script should now generate an SBOM that aligns with your expectations regarding how Python packages are represented. If you have any further adjustments or specific requirements you'd like to implement, feel free to ask!
