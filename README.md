To add the `logging.debug` statement in your `get_dependencies` function for detailed debugging, and to ensure the response from the GitHub API is logged, you can make the following modifications:

### Updated `get_dependencies` Function with Debugging

```python
def get_dependencies(owner, repo, access_token):
    """
    Fetches the dependencies for a given GitHub repository using the dependency graph API.

    Args:
        owner (str): The owner of the repository.
        repo (str): The name of the repository.
        access_token (str): The GitHub access token.

    Returns:
        dict: The JSON response containing the SBOM data.
    """
    logging.info(f"Fetching dependencies for repo: {owner}/{repo}")
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependency-graph/sbom"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"token {access_token}",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        logging.info(f"GitHub API response status: {response.status_code}")
        response.raise_for_status()  # Will raise an exception for non-2xx responses
        
        # Log the API response in debug mode to inspect the returned JSON
        logging.debug(f"Dependency graph API response: {json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)}")
        
        logging.info("Successfully fetched dependencies.")
        return response.json()
    
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        logging.error(f"HTTP error occurred while fetching dependencies for {owner}/{repo}: {http_err}")
        raise
    except Exception as err:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred while fetching dependencies for {owner}/{repo}: {err}")
        raise
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Debug Logging**: Added `logging.debug` to log the full API response in a readable JSON format. This will help you understand the structure of the `dependencies` object.
   - `logging.debug(f"Dependency graph API response: {json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)}")`
   
2. **Error Handling**: Added `try-except` blocks to handle HTTP and general exceptions. If an error occurs during the request, it logs the error message.
   
3. **Logging Configuration**: Ensure that your logging configuration allows debug-level messages:
   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
   ```

### How to Run:
1. **Enable Debug Output**: Make sure your script runs with the `DEBUG` logging level, so the `logging.debug` messages are shown in the console or log file.
2. **Run Your Script**: Once you run the script, check the console or the output log for the detailed response from the GitHub API.

### Example Debug Output:
The `logging.debug` line will print the entire JSON structure returned by GitHub's dependency graph API. Here's an example of how the output might look in the log:

```plaintext
2024-11-26 12:34:56 - DEBUG - Dependency graph API response: {
  "sbom": {
    "packages": [
      {
        "name": "pip:example-package",
        "versionInfo": "^1.0.0"
      },
      {
        "name": "npm:another-package",
        "versionInfo": "~2.3.4"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will help you confirm that you're getting the expected dependencies from the GitHub API and allow you to see if there are any discrepancies in the data returned.
